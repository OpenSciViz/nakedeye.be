A post apocolyptic dystopian perspective on the future of science in America (USA, need Eisenhower quote
about tbe "military industrial complex" and a ref to "The Merchants of War"):

Federal funding of science shall be restricted to national defense needs and all such work shall be classified.
Any other types of basic science research shall not (by law) be funded by tax payers, but may be funded privately,
and must be for profit. Any private research that leads to potential national security benefits must be converted
to classified trade secret status and shared with a designated Federal gov. lab. Any private research that does not
yield a marketable and profitable result with 10 years must be abandoned, and all related materials confiscated into
Federal management.
